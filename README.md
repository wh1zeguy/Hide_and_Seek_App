1 device that displays a play activity first with button options to “Play”, “Setup”, and “Quit”. A second activity that shows when you press the “Play” button. To choose the location go to the “Setup” button and enter the location of the desired location, there will be a “Quit” button for this. After you press “Play” the game begins and starts counting down on a score/timer, while the game is being played you can press hint buttons to reduce the  score, but give hints as to where the location is. The game will use the GPS locator to choose the location and when the phone’s GPS matches with the current location(or really close) then the game is over and score is displayed, or if the player losses, then “Game Over is" is displayed with two buttons, “Play Again” and “Quit”.
